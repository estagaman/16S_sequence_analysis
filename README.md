Repository for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing using PacBio 

featured tools: cutadapt, DADA2, MaAslin2, Decontam, phyloseq, tidyverse, and ggplot 

This repository provides scripts for analysis of both Illumina and PacBio 16S gene amplicon sequencing. 
I've also included scripts for taxonomy assignment using the Greengenes2 and SILVA databases. 
Decontam.R includes a guide on testing for batch effects between sample groups using the tool Decontam.
